# Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub. This space documents my learning journey in data analytics, Python, SQL, and computer infrastructure fundamentals. Most of the repositories here come from structured study programmes, assessments, and guided projects that helped me build a solid technical foundation.

## 📘 About Me

I am an engineering and workflow coordination professional transitioning into data analytics.  
My background includes calibration, technical systems, documentation, and cross‑departmental problem‑solving.  
Although my GitHub does not contain engineering projects, the mindset I developed in that environment, including precision, structure, and clear communication, continues to influence how I approach technical work.

I am currently focused on:

- Python scripting and data handling  
- SQL and relational database design  
- Exploratory data analysis and reproducible workflows  
- Understanding how systems operate at the OS and infrastructure level  
- Building a portfolio that reflects real, practical skills rather than artificial or over‑polished examples  

I value clarity, maintainability, and logical structure in everything I build.  
This GitHub is a transparent record of my progress as I develop into a data‑driven professional.
